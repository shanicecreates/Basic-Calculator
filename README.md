# Python-Calculator

The application uses a command-line-style interface to gather the operators and operands from the user and outputs the computed result. This calculator also supports additon, subtraction, multiplication and division. I've also included a simple test that will test to make that the application runs properky

# Installation

# Basic Implementations
Here are some simple implementations and their results

print(f"2 + 2 = {calculate('add', 2, 2)}")
print(f"5 - 3 = {calculate('subtract', 5, 3)}")
print(f"10 * 5 = {calculate('multiply', 10, 5)}")
print(f"9 / 3 = {calculate('divide', 9, 3)}")

Results 
2 + 2 = 4
5 - 3 = 2
10 * 5 = 50
9 / 3 = 3.0
